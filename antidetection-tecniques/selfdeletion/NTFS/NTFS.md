add NTFS "kaw" to testNotepad.txt
Add-Content -Value "NTFS" -Path "testNotepad.txt" -Stream "kaw"

view the content (cmd)  (use GetItem() to get NTFS of some file)
dir /r

when trying to delete/move this file with edited proprieties it
should shows a warning popup... I cant reproduce it probably due
to some strange configuration but i hope it works as a protection.
